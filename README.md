- Cat is an simple yet powerful and effective malicious software removal tool, mainly focusing on Remote tools, Worm and Ransomware. Cat is completely free to use and there is no type of "Premium" version of cat, the only offical place to get Cat is from this repository. There is no "Upgraded" or "Premium" version of Cat.

## ‚ö† Common Mistakes:
1. Not running Cat.exe as admin: Without admin CAT can't fully scan your device.
2. Not adding exclusion: Cat does not have a signature yet, So this can be marked as "virus".
3. Connected to VPN or Internet: Before running Cat, Please disconnect **FULLY** from internet and VPN.

## üåê Why disconnect from VPN and Internet?
- For RAT's to work they either need internet to communicate with the server, or be on same network.
