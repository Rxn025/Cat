# üê± Cat

- CAT is a simple, powerful, and effective malicious software removal tool. It mainly targets Remote Access Tools (RATs), Worms, and Ransomware.
- CAT is completely free to use ‚Äî there is **no premium version**, **no upgrade**, and **no hidden charges**.  
- The **only official** place to download CAT is this repository.

## ‚ö† Common Mistakes

1. **Not running CAT as administrator**  
   Without admin privileges, CAT cannot fully scan or clean the system.

2. **No antivirus exclusion**  
   CAT does not have a digital signature yet, so some antiviruses may falsely detect it.

3. **Connected to the internet or VPN**  
   Always disconnect **fully** from the internet and VPN before running CAT.

## üåê Why disconnect from VPN and Internet?

Most remote threats (like RATs) require an active internet connection to communicate with their command servers or be on the same local network. Disconnecting cuts off their control path, helping CAT safely terminate them.
